# Code to reproduce simulations 1 to 6

This subfolder contains the R scripts necessary to reproduce the results of simulations 1 to 6 of our manuscript on penalized regression calibration (PRC).

The `data_generation` folder contains the scripts to generate the data for each of the six simulations, whereas the `model_estimation` folder contains the scripts employed to estimate the statistical models evaluated in these simulations. The `functions` folder contains a set of functions that are sourced from various scripts.

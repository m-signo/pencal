## What is pencal?
`pencal` is the `R` package that implements Penalized Regression Calibration (PRC), a statistical method that we proposed in Signorelli *et al.* (2021). Penalized regression calibration: A method for the prediction of survival outcomes using complex longitudinal and high-dimensional data. *Statistics in Medicine*.

## About this repository
This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the simulations presented in Signorelli et al. (in review). It is divided into 3 subfolders:

* `simulations_PRC_LMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 1 to 6;
* `simulations_PRC_MLPMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 7 to 12;
* `supplementary` contains the results of the simulations presented in the supplementary material.

## How to download pencal
`pencal` is an `R` package that can be downloaded from `CRAN`. This can be done in `R` through the command 
```
install.packages('pencal')
```

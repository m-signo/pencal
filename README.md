# Penalized Regression Calibration (PRC): a novel method to predict survival using longitudinal and high-dimensional predictors

This repository contains R scripts used in the manuscript of Signorelli, M., Spitali, P., Tsonaka, R. (2020, in review). On the prediction of survival outcomes using longitudinal and high-dimensional (omic) data.

## About this repository
This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the simulations presented in Signorelli, Spitali and Tsonaka (2020, in review). It is divided into two subfolders:

* `simulations_PRC_LMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 1 to 6;
* `simulations_PRC_MLPMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 7 to 12.

## What is pencal?
pencal is the R package that implements Penalized Regression Calibration (PRC), a statistical method that we proposed in Signorelli *et al.* (2021). Penalized regression calibration: A method for the prediction of survival outcomes using complex longitudinal and high-dimensional data. *Statistics in Medicine*.

## About this repository
This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the simulations presented in Signorelli et al. (in review). It is divided into two subfolders:

* `simulations_PRC_LMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 1 to 6;
* `simulations_PRC_MLPMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 7 to 12.

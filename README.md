This repository contains R scripts used in the manuscript of Signorelli, Spitali, Al-Khalili Szigyarto, The Mark-MD Consortium, and Tsonaka (in review). Penalized regression calibration: a method for the prediction of survival outcomes using complex longitudinal and high-dimensional data.

## About this repository
This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the simulations presented in Signorelli et al. (in review). It is divided into two subfolders:

* `simulations_PRC_LMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 1 to 6;
* `simulations_PRC_MLPMM` contains the scripts used for simulations 7 to 12.

# Code to reproduce simulations 7 to 12

This subfolder contains the R scripts necessary to reproduce the results of simulations 7 to 12 of our manuscript on penalized regression calibration (PRC).

* The `data_generation` folder contains the scripts to generate the data for each of the six simulations.
* The `model_estimation_ridge` and `model_estimation_elasticnet` folders contain the scripts employed to estimate the statistical models evaluated in these simulations, and to summarize their results.
* The `functions` folder contains a set of functions that are sourced from the scripts for data generation and model estimation.
